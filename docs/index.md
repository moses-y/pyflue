    PyFlue is a Python-first agent harness framework for building autonomous
    agents with Markdown skills, persistent sessions, sandboxed filesystem
    access, shell execution, typed Pydantic outputs, and pluggable harness
    backends. It is inspired by the
    <a href="https://flueframework.com">Flue framework</a> and adapts the
    agent harness pattern for Python teams.

```bash
uv add pyflue
pyflue init my-agent
cd my-agent
pyflue run --prompt "Review this project"
```

```bash
pip install pyflue
pyflue init my-agent
cd my-agent
pyflue run --prompt "Review this project"
```

## Why PyFlue

PyFlue gives Python developers a framework-shaped agent runtime instead of a
collection of low-level primitives. The default backend is DeepAgents, with a
stable PyFlue API layered above it.

PyFlue is inspired by Flue's agent harness model: Markdown skills, stateful
sessions, sandboxed tools, typed outputs, and deployable agent entrypoints.
PyFlue adapts those ideas for Python teams with Pydantic, Python packaging,
and Python-friendly deployment targets.

The public model is simple:

```python
agent = await init(model="openai:gpt-4o", harness="deepagents")
session = await agent.session("issue-123")
result = await session.skill("triage", args={"issue_number": 123}, result=FixResult)
```

PyFlue is designed for Python teams that want the ergonomics of a modern agent
harness while keeping access to the Python ecosystem. It is useful for coding
agents, data workflows, support automation, and service agents that need
structured outputs and controlled access to files or shell commands.

## What You Can Build

PyFlue gives you the core pieces needed for agentic workflows:

- project instructions from `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`
- reusable Markdown skills in `.agents/skills`
- stateful sessions backed by SQLite
- a virtual sandbox with read, write, edit, grep, glob, and shell tools
- Pydantic validation for typed results
- a DeepAgents runtime backend
- a backend registry for future OpenAI Agents, Google ADK, Pydantic AI, and
  custom harness backends
- streaming events through Python, CLI, and SSE
- route triggers for file-based webhook agents
- secret grants for shell and prompt calls
- command allowlists and compound-command protection
- deployment files for Docker/FastAPI, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Railway,
  Render, Fly.io, Vercel, Netlify, and Cloudflare starter projects

## Minimal Python Example

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from pyflue import init


class FixResult(BaseModel):
    fix_applied: bool
    summary: str


async def main():
    agent = await init(
        model="openai:gpt-4o",
        harness="deepagents",
        sandbox="virtual",
        allow_write=True,
        allow_shell=True,
    )

    session = await agent.session("fix-123")
    result = await session.skill(
        "triage",
        args={"issue_number": 123},
        result=FixResult,
    )

    if result.fix_applied:
        await session.shell("git status --short")
```
